                            <p>As a group of 6 people, we had to create a document that will act as a base for a web application to help administrate
                                a hockey club.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-0">Content</h4>
                            <p> Over the span of the first semester we had to collect information from our client and base a system on their requests.
                                This is easier said then done, due to us not having the same exact end result in mind compared to the client.
                                We would make schemes and write explanations about all the functions it had to contain and how it would work.
                                Our goal was to give it functionality and make sure all the pieces would fit well together.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Result</h4>
                            <p>After going a lot of back and forward we were able to create a prototype, the client is satisfied with our prototype.
                                The prototype we made has been forwarded to another group, so they may start the actual development of the application. 
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-0">Conclusion</h4>
                            <p> Communcation is key to projects. After a lot of trial and error we eventually made it happen due to everyone putting effort in it
                                and helping eachother when needed.

                            <p>As a group of 5 people, we had to start of with 15 euros and make profit by adding value to bought resources and selling them for charity.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-0">Content</h4>
                            <p> As a team it was quite a difficult decision to think what we could buy under 15 euros and add value to make profit.
                                After a lot of discussing we eventually decided to make colorful paper decoration for the holidays.
                                Everyone was assigned a role to help with the process of selling our products. However when it came to giving added value to the product,
                                everyone from our team gave it their all. We were also given the option to sell on campus which we've chosen in the end.
                                All our profit went to the charity for research against cancer.
                            </p>

                            <p>Once we we're done with selling our products we had a little over 40 euros in profit we could donate to charity.

                            </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-0">Conclusion</h4>
                            <p> As long as you can deticate yourself to it then you can make it happen. As our team had to go through a lot of hardships that
                                came with giving added value to the resources. But it worked out well in the end.

                            <p>For this project we had to make anything in C-sharp aslong as it contained some kind of database.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-0">Content</h4>
                            <p> I decided I would pick a library management as it seemed like a very simple thing to make.
                                For the project I made windows like logging in and editing books and users. A database was made with SQLite
                                , which was rather easy to use luckily. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Personally for the amount the time I was given I have gotten pretty far in developing the system.
                               I was pretty close to finishing it however.
                            </p>
                            <h4 class="mb-0">Conclusion</h4>
                            <p> Next time when I am considering to do a similar project like this I'll try not to bite off more than I can chew.
